{"name":"Bioeconomic MPA network design - R toolkit","tagline":"","body":"# Bioeconomic MPA network design - R toolkit\r\nThank you for your interest in the R toolkit for the bioeconomic evaluation of MPA network design! If you haven't already done so, please refer to the manuscript describing the model results (insert link to manuscript once published).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nIf you would like to apply this toolkit to your own scenario, please fork this repository and modify as needed. We kindly ask that you cite both the original manuscript and this repository in any resulting publication. We recognize that there are some aspects of the model the could be closer to reality and we look forward to seeing how you would improve it. To make changes, we recommend starting with user_input.R, functions.R, or changing one or more of the sub-modules.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to replicate our results, download the repository as is and run the simulations by running the code in master.R. This script will source the user defined parameters (user_input.R), the custom MPA toolkit functions (functions.R), and the various MPA toolkit sub-modules.\r\n\r\n**Please note:** This toolkit requires the installation of R packages before use (dplyr, ggplot2 grid, Grid2Polygons, gridExtra, maptools, raster, readr, rgdal*, rgeos, sp, tidyr)\r\n>*installation of the rgdal package is notoriously difficult, please see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15248815/rgdal-package-installation) and [here](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/index.html) for further information should you have any problems.\r\n\r\n## Parameterization\r\nSuch a complex model requires many parameters to function properly.

Modify the values to customize the biological, economic, or spatial parameters of your model. You will also find the logical switches (TRUE/FALSE) to turn on/off the analysis mode (analyzing data that was previously written to disk or running the full model), the time loop plots, as well as switches that dictate the use of connectivity matrices (or alternatively the random dispersal function) and the generation of new protection scenarios (or alternatively using those previously written to disk).\r\n\r\n#### [functions.R](https://github.com/remi-daigle/bioeconomic_MPA/blob/master/functions.R)\r\nThis sub-module has all the custom functions created specifically for this toolbox. These functions are not contained in downloadable packages.\r\n\r\n#### [time_loop_plots.R](https://github.com/remi-daigle/bioeconomic_MPA/blob/master/time_loop_plots.R)\r\nThis sub-module is a script used to plot some pertinent results between each time loops so you can keep an eye on your model as it runs. This will slow performance slightly, but is very handy for troubleshooting\r\n\r\n#### [publication_figures.R](https://github.com/remi-daigle/bioeconomic_MPA/blob/master/publication_figures.R)\r\nThis sub-module generates the figures used in our final publication.

Larval mortality is enforced herein.\r\n\r\n### Dispersal\r\nThe sub-modules within this module will disperse adults and larvae.\r\n\r\n#### [larval_dispersal.R](https://github.com/remi-daigle/bioeconomic_MPA/blob/master/larval_dispersal.R)\r\nThis sub-module uses either the random dispersal function or the connectivity matrices to disperse the larvae. Settlement mortality is enforced herein. If using custom connectivity matrices please place them in the con_mat directory and follow the naming convention of `con_mat_PHASE_YEAR.csv` where `PHASE` is either `adult` or `larvae` and `YEAR` is the calendar year (_e.g._ 1998) and have source polygon as row names, settlement polygon as column names.\r\n\r\n#### [adult_dispersal.R](https://github.com/remi-daigle/bioeconomic_MPA/blob/master/adult_dispersal.R)\r\nThis sub-module uses either the random dispersal function or the connectivity matrices to disperse the adults. \r\n\r\n### Harvesting\r\nThe sub-modules within this module regulates the management and behaviour of the fishing industry.\r\n\r\n#### [fisher_management.R](https://github.com/remi-daigle/bioeconomic_MPA/blob/master/fisher_managment.R)\r\nThis sub-module will estimate the fisheries quota and set which grid cells are \"fishable\" (_i.e._ not covered by an active MPA). \r\n\r\n#### [fisher_behaviour.R](https://github.com/remi-daigle/bioeconomic_MPA/blob/master/fisher_behaviour.R)\r\nThis sub-module calculates fishing effort and allows fishermen catch fish by minimizing effort. \r\n\r\n### Cost Evaluation\r\nThe sub-modules within this module will evaluate the value and costs of the fisheries over time.\r\n\r\n#### [fish_value.R](https://github.com/remi-daigle/bioeconomic_MPA/blob/master/fish_value.R)\r\nThis sub-module will evaluate operating costs and calculate landed value of all fish caught. \r\n\r\n#### [MPA_impl_enforcement.R](https://github.com/remi-daigle/bioeconomic_MPA/blob/master/MPA_impl_enforcement.R)\r\nThis sub-module will evaluate the cost of enforcing the MPA network for each scenario. we did not use these costs in our case study as we considered these costs external to the fishing industry. \r\n\r\n#### [social_discount.R](https://github.com/remi-daigle/bioeconomic_MPA/blob/master/social_discount.R)\r\nThis sub-module applies the social discount rates to the net catch values to calculate the net present values. \r\n","google":"UA-50638009-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
